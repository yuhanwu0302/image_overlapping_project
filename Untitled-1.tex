Certainly! Here is the LaTeX code for the PDF of the Weibull distribution:

$f(x; \lambda, k) = \frac{k}{\lambda} \left(\frac{x}{\lambda}\right)^{k-1} e^{-(x/\lambda)^k}$

And here is the LaTeX code for the expression you provided, after substituting $x = e^{a(\ln y - \ln b)}$:

$f(y; \lambda, k) = \frac{k}{\lambda} \left(\frac{e^{a(\ln y - \ln b)}}{\lambda}\right)^{k-1} e^{-(e^{a(\ln y - \ln b)}/\lambda)^k}$

$f(y; \lambda, k) = \frac{k}{\lambda} \left(\frac{y}{b}\right)^{k-1} e^{-\left(\frac{y}{\lambda b^{-1/k}}\right)^k}$

I hope this helps!
